//! 29 HTTP The section describes the u-blox proprietary AT commands that can be
//! used for sending requests to a remote HTTP server, receiving the server
//! response and transparently storing it in the file system. The supported
//! methods are: HEAD, GET, DELETE, PUT, POST file and POST data. A PSD or CSD
//! connection must be activated before using HTTP AT commands.
//!

//!   for establishing a PSD connection.
